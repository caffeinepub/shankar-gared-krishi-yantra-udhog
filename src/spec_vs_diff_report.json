  "summary": "Logo and hero image sources were updated in Header/Footer/Hero to point to the uploaded Gemini images, but the actual image asset files were not added to the repo per the diff summary, so REQ-24 is not implemented. REQ-25 and REQ-26 appear implemented at the component level (image src replacements and hero overlay retained), though the required assets are not evidenced as present.",
