  "summary": "Diff adds a top-level React error boundary with user-visible recovery actions, introduces an invalid-view-state fallback screen (instead of returning null/blank), and hardens product field + image URL handling across Shop, Gallery, and Buy Product via safe helpers and a SafeProductImage placeholder renderer. Query hooks also add guarded actor checks and error logging/retry to reduce uncaught initial-render failures.",
