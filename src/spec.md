# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Apply the user-uploaded logo and background images across the marketing website to update branding.

**Planned changes:**
- Add the 4 uploaded image files to the frontend static assets folder (per existing convention) with original filenames and ensure they are accessible via `/assets/...` URLs.
- Replace the current Header and Footer logo image with the uploaded logo image, keeping the existing English alt text and maintaining responsive sizing/alignment.
- Replace the current Hero background image with the uploaded background image, keeping/adjusting the existing overlay/gradient to maintain strong text contrast and readability.

**User-visible outcome:** The website shows the new uploaded logo in the Header and Footer, and the Hero section displays the new uploaded background image with readable text and working image links.
